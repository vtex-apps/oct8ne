## About
Interact with your customers in real time.
Help your customers by showing them images and videos of your products using the coviewer to help them along in the decision making process.

## Functionalities
-Coviewer
Discover a more interactive shopping experience by using the coviewer to see what your customers see in real time. You will be able to show products and interact with clients in order to increase sales implementing up-selling and cross-selling techniques. Users as well, will be able to upload their own images to show you exactly what they are looking for, such as broken or similar items.

-Catalog Integration
Show images and videos of your products in one click through the coviewer. The integration of the catalog together with the visual support allow to reproduce the experience of a brick and mortar store.

-Browsing history
You can see your customer’s interests by accessing their browsing history. You’ll be able to see which products they’ve looked at to offer personalized customer service and guide the customer throughout the purchase process. You won't have to worry about privacy: the only thing the agent will be able to see is the browsing history but not the full screen of the client.

-Predictive algorithms
Anticipate your customers’ questions through automatic algorithms that detect the ideal time to communicate with your clients, for example when users have been on your website for a long time, when they have compared several products or when the cart value reaches a specific amount. Stay ahead of critical situations and capture customers before they have questions.

-Video call
If you need to talk face to face with your client, you can continue the conversation through an Oct8ne video call that also allows you to share screens.

-Phone Pin
Connect with customers you’re attending on the phone through the coviewer too, by entering a code. The communication is always easier if you can both see what you’re talking about in real time.

-Chat Bot
Our chatbot is fully integrated with the live chat to facilitate the work of your agents, answering automatically in just a second, understanding the natural language in several languages and, when clients need personalized advice, it will transfer the query to a human. It increases sales thanks to real-time assistance when your agents are not connected, as well as collecting data from potential buyers. If you use another bot system, you can also integrate it with the Oct8ne chat.

-Multi-language interface
Oct8ne adapts to the language your pages are in, so your customers feel comfortable from anywhere in the world.

-Reports
You will have data about conversations and the images shown in the coviewer in real time and you’ll be able to keep track of all activity.

-Managing workload
Increase productivity thanks to features designed to increase sales and help you save time.
