1.- Levels of Service. . OCT8NE offers the following levels of service:

1.  a) a) Service Availability : OCT8NE strives to provide the Services on a 24/7 basis. We try to avoid planning scheduled interruption periods during normal service hours or peak hours for the Service.
2.  b) Reliability of the Service: OCT8NE guarantees the time of availability of the Platform to 99% on an annual basis, except for scheduled interruptions and cases of force majeure. Scheduled interruptions will last less than 8 hours per month and will not exceed six (6) events/month. We will notify the Customer at least 48 hours before any scheduled interruptions.

Besides the scheduled interruption time, the availability of the service is guaranteed as follows:

| Availability % | Interruption / year | Interruption / month | Interruption / week |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 99% | 4 days | 8 hours | 2 hours |

Also, the level of reliability ("availability") depends on the availability and response times of Microsoft Azure, whose policies are exposed in the links indicated at the end of the document.

1.  c) Maintenance Service: Unscheduled interruptions will be resolved according to the severity levels defined in Section 5.
2.  d) Backups of data Backup copies of customer data are made regularly using the systems provided by Microsoft Azure. At least one full backup is done every week and the copy is stored for 35 days. In each week at least one incremental copy is stored daily.
